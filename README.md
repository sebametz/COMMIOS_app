### Wellcome to COMMIOS app!

Ancient DNA (aDNA) has revolutionised our understanding of human history, revealing details about population movements and interactions. The [COMMIOS project](https://commiosarchaeology.wordpress.com/) integrates biomolecular and archaeological approaches to provide a holistic view of Iron Age communities in Britain within a European context. To date, over 1,000 individuals have been sequenced to investigate the mobility and kinship of ancient populations and their relation to modern populations. To manage and disseminate these data, we are developing the **COMMIOS web application**, which:

  - Enable the exploration of genetic data alongside archaeological findings
  - Facilitate comparative analyses between ancient and modern populations
  - Offer tools for analysing genetic diversity and population structure
  - Promote data sharing and collaborative research.

The **COMMIOS web application** collected ancient DNA data from **[COMMIOS project](https://commiosarchaeology.wordpress.com/)** and from the **Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR)** [Mallick et al., 2024][1].
