# Introduction

Ancient DNA (aDNA) has revolutionised our understanding of human history, revealing details about population movements and interactions. The [COMMIOS project](https://commiosarchaeology.wordpress.com/) integrates biomolecular and archaeological approaches to provide a holistic view of Iron Age communities in Britain within a European context. To date, over 1,000 individuals have been sequenced to investigate the mobility and kinship of ancient populations and their relation to modern populations. To manage and disseminate these data, we are developing the **COMMIOS web application**, which will enable the exploration of genetic data alongside archaeological findings; Facilitate comparative analyses between ancient and modern populations; Offer tools for analysing genetic diversity and population structure; and promote data sharing and collaborative research.

## Data

All data used by this application were either produced by [COMMIOS team](https://commiosarchaeology.wordpress.com/people/) or are available from the **Allen Ancient DNA Resource (AADR)** [Mallick et al., 2024][1]. The table containing information on all the individuals used in this web application can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/sebametz/COMMIOS_app). For more information about the meaning of the different columns, follow this [link](./other/helpTable.md). We have restricted the visualisation to ancient individuals from the Neolithic to the Medieval period, with the periods defined as in [Patterson et al., (2022)][2]

## Application usage

The application has two main inputs: a map and a Time Series plot of ancient population contributions to each individual. To generate plots for any individual, click on your chosen individual in either the map or the Time Series plot.

The map shows all the ancient individuals from Britain and Ireland that are available. The Time Series shows the contributions of ancient populations, calculated using an admixture model (EEF + WHG + Yamnaya) with qpAdmixture ([Patterson et al., 2012][3], [Maier & Patterson, 2024][4]).

The map and Time Series inputs are responsive to each other. When you click on an individual on the map, the Time Series will automatically highlight that individual. Similarly, when you click on a point in the Time Series, the map will automatically zoom in on that individual’s location.

Plots specific to that individual will be rendered automatically. Several analyses and pieces of information are available, and outputs will automatically update whenever the user adjusts one of the input widgets.

## Map elements

The individuals on the map are clustered together for better visualisation, as one site can have many individuals. When you hover over an individual, the Genetic ID and sex (M: Male, F: Female, and U: Unknown) will be displayed. If an individual is clicked, more information will pop up. Various topographic and satellite base layers are available. To activate any of these layers, hover the mouse over the layers control box (top right of the map) and select one. To filter individuals from specific periods, select the desired period in the top checkbox widget.

## Time series

The individuals in the Time Series are colour-coded according to their country. They can be plotted according to their contributions from Early European Farmers (EEF), Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), and Yamnaya pastoralists (Steppe) using the Time Series parameter selection at the top.

When an individual is clicked, detailed information is displayed at the bottom. The status information includes the P-value of the admixture model; if it is lower than **<span style="color:red">0.01</span>**, the status will alert you to this. Sample quality includes details such as the number of SNPs and whether there is any contamination.

The qpAdmixture plot can be viewed at the bottom right, showing the percentage contribution of each ancient population to the selected individual.

## Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

A PCA can be generated by selecting this option from the Plot Type selector at the top. The selected individual will be highlighted with a pink diamond. To explore the similarity between the selected individual and a reference group, choose the group from the References selection panel, and the individuals will be added to the PCA. Western European modern individuals are displayed in grey.

Hover over the different reference individuals in the PCA to obtain more information.

## Ancient contribution (Ternary plot)

The Ancient Contribution or Ternary plot provides another way to explore the contributions of ancient populations to a selected individual or a group of reference individuals chosen from the selection panel. Clicking on an individual in the plot will display detailed information. 

## Table

The table contains all the individuals from the COMMIOS project and the AADR that are from Britain and Ireland and appear on the map. For a complete table with all reference individuals and information about the admixture models and PCA, download it from [GitHub](https://github.com/sebametz/COMMIOS_app).
